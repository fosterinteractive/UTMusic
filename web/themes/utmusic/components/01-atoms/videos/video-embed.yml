description: 'Clover Thursday is the person you remember, even if you\’ve only met her for a moment. She has an easy smile, her hair colour is forever-changing and she’s covered in art. Pins and patches of cute cartoon characters—mermaids, octopuses and other creatures of pastel whimsy—are spread out before her on a desk.'
